ReversISEC is a variation of the popular game Reversi, the core of the game logic is mostly unchaged, there are however two aditional features the players must take in consideration when playing.

 As the name may suggest this feature allows the player to make two turns in sucession, in order to make this feature balanced the player may only make this action once a game.
 
 ### Skip Turn
